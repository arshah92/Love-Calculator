## Love Calculator

# Instructions

This program tests the compatibility between two people.  

To work out the love score between two people:

> It take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number. And that 2 digit number is your love score.


If the Love Scores **less than 10** or **greater than 90**, then "you go together like coke and mentos."` 

For Love Scores **between 40** and **50**, then "you are alright together."`

For remaining love scores, You guys are a great match. Do not leave each other :P

e.g. 

`name1 = "Angela Yu"`

`name2 = "Jack Bauer"`
